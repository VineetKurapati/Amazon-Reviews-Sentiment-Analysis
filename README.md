# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

## Introduction:
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of Amazon reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The sentiment analysis is performed using two different models: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). 

## Data:
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Amazon reviews. It contains various fields such as review text, score, and ID. The dataset is preprocessed and utilized for sentiment analysis.

## Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For tokenization, POS tagging, and chunking
- Transformers library: For utilizing pre-trained NLP models
- VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer: For sentiment analysis using lexicon and rule-based approach
- Cardiff Twitter RoBERTa Base model: A pre-trained model for sentiment analysis

## Methodology:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The distribution of reviews by score is visualized using a bar plot.
   - Textual data preprocessing is performed using NLTK, including tokenization, POS tagging, and chunking.

2. **Sentiment Analysis with VADER**:
   - VADER model is used to analyze the sentiment of the reviews. 
   - Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) are calculated and visualized.

3. **Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa**:
   - The Cardiff Twitter RoBERTa Base model is utilized for sentiment analysis.
   - Pre-trained RoBERTa model is used to predict sentiment scores for each review.
   - Scores are softmax-normalized and categorized into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments.

4. **Integration of Results**:
   - VADER and RoBERTa sentiment analysis results are combined for comprehensive sentiment insights.
   - The final results include sentiment scores from both models along with other relevant information.

## Usage:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Run the provided Python script to perform sentiment analysis on the Amazon reviews dataset.
3. Examine the generated visualizations and sentiment analysis results to gain insights into the sentiment distribution of the reviews.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews. By leveraging both lexicon-based (VADER) and deep learning-based (RoBERTa) approaches, comprehensive sentiment insights are obtained. The integration of multiple models enhances the robustness and accuracy of sentiment analysis, providing valuable information for understanding customer sentiment towards Amazon products.
